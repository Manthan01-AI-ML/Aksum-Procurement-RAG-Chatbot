üöÄ Project Overview

Procurement teams often waste hours searching through:

Supplier contracts (delivery penalties, payment terms)

Procurement policies (credit norms, GST rules, return windows)

Invoices & POs (payment cycles, HSN codes)

Internal FAQs

This chatbot answers procurement queries in seconds by combining:

Document retrieval (via FAISS + embeddings)

Pin-point extractive answers (regex + semantic search)

Optional LLM polish (OpenAI, Hugging Face, or Ollama for natural answers + citations)

üëâ Goal: Reduce query resolution time, increase transparency, and empower procurement staff to self-serve.
